# Post Teaching Notes

## February 8, 2015

* Early feedback was very positive but that said there are lots of ideas for how to improve the course.
* We did not have time to go through all of the course materials. Should consider shortening expectations.
* Some suggest that we somehow separate the Swift materials into another workshop entirely and maybe leave it to a reading exercise to those who are already regularly programming.
* Having 3 TAs for 12 people was extremely helpful. Doing it with less would have been a real challenge.
* Considering the women target audience try to make the names more gender balanced.
* Some would prefer time in between the classes (this was a consecutive sat and sun) to experiment on their own.
* Considering `Float` isn't recommended we probably should lessen the amount we talk about it.
