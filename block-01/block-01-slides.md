# Introduction to iOS Development

^ Welcome!

# About Me

^ My name is Michael Zornek. I've been an Apple developer since 2001. Early on it was mainly a hobby of mine and then got more professional as I started to build and sell products. Eventually the iPhone was announced and I was  put into a great scenario since I had all this previous knowledge from the Mac. 

^ Over the last few years I've done lots of iPhone development through a mix of personal project as well as lots of consulting projects.

# Requirements

* A Macintosh running OS X.
* Xcode Developer Tools (Free)

* Apple Developer Account (Free or $99/year)

^ Paid for account req for on device install and store submission

# The iOS Ecosystem
--- 
# [fit] Centralized & Anonymous
# Distribution

^ Must distribute through Apple App Store
^ Very little info on your actual customer
^ Can use Enterprise Membership for In House distribution

--- 

# To get on the store:

* Active developer membership ($99)
* Follow Apple's "App Store Review Guidelines" [^2]
* Have your app reviewed by Apple (4-10 days)

[^2]: <https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/>

^ Unwritten rule: one "expedited review" per year.

--- 

# Money

* You are licensing your app to Apple to sell on your behalf.
* Apple pays out monthly with a 6-8 week backlog.
* Apple does not pay taxes on your behalf.
* If you have large international sales, look into country-specific tax laws.

# WWDC 2014

## A disturbance in the force...

--- 

# Swift

^ Announced at WWDC 2014 in June

^ Shipped with iOS 8 in September

--- 

# Why?

--- 

# Objective-C

^ Been at the heard of OS X since it was NextStep in 1989.

^ C based language

^ Very small addition to C

^ Very fast.

^ Very susceptible to C problems (memory, pointers, uninitialized variables)

--- 

> "Objective-C without the baggage of C"

--- 

# Differences

--- 

## Objective-C
## (Object Oriented Programming)
### ****
## Swift
## (Functional Programming)

^ functional prefers

^ non-mutability

^ structs over classes

^ pass by value instead of reference

--- 

## Objective-C
## (Weak Typed)
### ****
## Swift
## (Strong Typed)

^ need to be expressive about intended use

^ optionals wrap nil possible values

--- 
# More Swift Details 

* Requires you to be more "expressive" about intent.
* Offers a REPL which enables Playgrounds
* Built with Objective-C and iOS SDK interoperability from the beginning. 
* A first class App Store citizen.

^ Read Eval Print Loop

--- 

# Swift

^ We will be using Swift in this workshop

^ I am still learning Swift too.

^ It is the future of the platform.

--- 

# Xcode Tour

--- 

# Challenge

^ Launch Xcode

^ Launch a playground
