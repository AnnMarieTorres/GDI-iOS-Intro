## Your GDI: Intro to iOS workshop is this weekend!

Hi everyone! Introduction to iOS is coming up this weekend. Hope you are all as excited as I am. :)

I wanted to go over a few things in preparation for our time together:

1. As the event description says you are required to bring a laptop running Mac OS X. You should also have the Xcode tools (version 6.1) installed. If you do not have Xcode please download it from the Mac App Store or Apple's developer site.
2. Since our workshop happens through lunchtime we'll have breaks around noon. We are allowed to eat in the space so please consider bringing a brown bag lunch (I'm told a fridge will be available) so you can continue to socialize with your fellow attendees while you eat. If needed, you can also find lunch around town during break.

If you have any questions let me know.
