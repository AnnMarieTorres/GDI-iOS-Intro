[Philly CocoaHeads](http://phillycocoa.org/) in general is a great place to meet other developers and socialize. If you are looking to get 1-on-1 help be sure to check out their [Side Project Saturday events](http://www.meetup.com/PhillyCocoaHeads/).

Apple's own [Swift website](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) has tons of info and outgoing links.

Big Nerd Ranch has some [great classes](https://training.bignerdranch.com/) and some of the most [popular instruction books](http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/ios-programming.html) for the platform. Yes, there are updated versions focusing on Swift and iOS 8 in the works (the current version uses Objective-C on iOS 7) but that said I still recommend the current edition as a great starting point for people to new to iOS.
